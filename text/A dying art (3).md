# A dying art

Farming always seemed like a slow, dirty, unrewarding occupation. Every morning I would wake up and peer out my window, with the paint chipping on the frame, and I knew with certainty that my father would be working in the crops. The sun would just be gliding over the horizon, yet he had been out there for hours. 
	
My father would stride in the house, and smile at me with his leathery tan face. He would hand me a fresh garden tomato to pack for my lunch. Other children at my school had lunches that consisted of pudding cups, lunchable, hot pockets, and various sugary processed foods that made my mouth water. While mine, a poor farmers daughter, would have a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a garden tomato for a side, and a homegrown apple for dessert. I grunted at my father as I took the bright red tomato from his calloused hands.  
	
Through watching my father farming, I learned how to love the earth, how to cherish it for all its glory and wrath. I learned that even on my bad days, or years, dedication and hard work would prevail. I learned how to work hard for what I had and if I wasn’t satisfied with what I had, to work even harder. Most importantly, I learned that farmers are artists. They paint the landscape with fields of every color. Their products bring joy, sustenance, and survival to us all. They are the conductor and the orchestra for the quality of life. Without them, nothing would be possible. 

Companys that buy from small local farmers are buying so much more than produce. They are supporting a farmer and their dreams. They are supporting a familys ability to go on vacation. They are supporting health and sustabaility. But most importantly they are supporting a cultural artform that has been dwindling in numbers and appreciation. 

## Trouble on the horizon:

Like myself as a young adult, many other young people have no desire to become full time farmers. The average age of a North Carolina farmer is almost 59 years old (Gergen, C., Martin, S., 2017). With the older generations of farmers, well getting older, and the younger generations are uninterested in farming, what will happen? Large farms will take over, and the art of farming will be lost by industrialized agriculture. 
	
 We are losing our small-town farming culture and rapidly. Agriculture has become an industry that depends on a large work force that can pay a low wage to promote healthy profit for the owners and shareholders (Linder, P. 2010). Most small farmers are getting squeezed out by larger, mass producing farms that are looking out for profit and not for the health of the product or the community in witch it serves. 
	
However, there is light at the end of the tunnel for small farmers. The organic food movement and other environmental movements brought on by works such as Pollan’s Omnivore Dilemma, Kingsolver’s Animal, vegetable, and Schlosser’s Fast Food Nation have shed light on the corruption of the agricultural industry (Linder, P. 2010). The people have noticed the issues that industrialization of agriculture have caused. Farmers markets, local produce, and organic food is becoming a more popular option among the public. 

# What you can do:

Support local! Buying local produce not only has great economic benefits, but you are helping revive a much-needed culture. Local small-time farmers that are barely hanging on need your support. The Veggie Wagon is a locally owned produce company that specializes in delivering local and sustainable produce. They travel to all the best local farms and small batch producers to bring the freshest and tastiest items North Carolina has to offer (Welcome to the Veggie Wagon)! 

To address the older population of farmers, the state needs to recruit a younger audience in this field to take over when the time comes. Several youth organizations, such as 4-H, and FFA work to develop children’s interest in agriculture through hands-on learning activities. These organizations build an appreciation and inspiration for our natural resources. It teaches children work ethic, ethical agriculture, and various other lifelong skills. North Carolina’s 4-H chapter has more than 208,000 participants. Leadership development opportunities are also provided by the Farm Bureau’s Institute for Future Agriculture Leaders and the North Carolina FFA (Gergen, C., Martin, S., (2017).
